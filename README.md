# Quack Attack: Zombie Quackdown

Welcome to Quack Attack: Zombie Quackdown, a thrilling top-down survival game where you play as a brave duck fighting off waves of relentless zombies! Inspired by the popular game Brotato, this project was developed as part of a university course on Functional Programming in Python using the Pygame library.

In Quack Attack: Zombie Quackdown, you must survive increasingly difficult waves of zombies, earn money for each kill, and use your hard-earned cash to upgrade your weapons or buy new ones in the shop after each run. Can you survive the zombie apocalypse and become the ultimate duck hero?
